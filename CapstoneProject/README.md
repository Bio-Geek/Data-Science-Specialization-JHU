### Capstone project for JHU Data Science Specialization, Coursera.

**NLP and App Development. Creating a Word Prediction Application.**

I have chosen to use Python (instead of R) for text processing for performance reasons.
I decided to write my own scripts rather than use existing packages,
because I wanted to be able to fine-tune my text processing pipeline on-the-fly.

The App is deployed on Shiny server.

The text data used for this project is from a corpus called HC Corpora,
